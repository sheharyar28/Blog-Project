        <h1>Assassin's Creed Infinity: everything we know so far</h1>
        <p>Assassin’s Creed Infinity promises big changes for Ubisoft’s series.
        Assassin’s Creed Infinity marks a huge step for Ubisoft's franchise. Historically, it's never been afraid of evolution, whether that's jumping through time periods or transitioning from a stealth action game to more of an RPG. 
        Following on from Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft’s next big project is Assassin’s Creed Infinity, which could represent a seismic shift for the franchise itself. Potentially, this could fundamentally change how the series works by taking a live service approach. 
        Revealed in a Bloomberg report that’s since been verified by Ubisoft, Assassin’s Creed Infinity looks set to tie future entries in the franchise together. In what exact form, we don't yet know, but is this cause for excitement or concern for AC fans? 
        Here's everything we know so far.
        </p>
        <h2>Release Date and Platforms</h2>
        <p>We don't have an official release date for Assassin's Creed Infinity at this time. 
        The Bloomberg report in July 2021, which confirmed the existence of Assassin’s Creed Infinity, stated this upcoming entry is “still years away from release.” 
        Later on, Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier clarified this statement, telling us it's “at least three years away”. 
        Ubisoft hasn't formally confirmed a release window, so that remains speculative, and we don't know what platforms its launching on. 
        We'd expect to see it on PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and PC, though if it's this far from launch, we can safely assume it'll skip Xbox One and PS4.

        <p>Ubisoft has confirmed the existence of Assassin’s Creed Infinity, but it hasn’t yet confirmed exactly what it will be. 
        So, what follows is a well-informed run-down based on the aforementioned Bloomberg report, and our own estimations based on our understanding of the situation.
        Assassin’s Creed Infinity won’t be a new Assassin’s Creed game – or, at least, it won’t be a standalone entry like Assassin’s Creed Vahalla. 
        Instead, it’ll be a future platform that will tie all the strands of the series together across multiple games.
        <br/><br/>
        A ‘live service’ (e.g, a gaming title that is continually updated and evolves with challenges and new content), Infinity is expected to be a central hub-like destination for fans of the series. 
        New games will likely launch on (or support) Assassin’s Creed Infinity, serving to more closely tie together games that are set across different time periods. As new eras are released, or expansions created, they’ll likely be added to Assassin’s Creed Infinity, perhaps with an overarching story or goal to unify the experience.</p>
    
    <h2>News and Rumors</h2>
    <p>Below, we've gathered up all the biggest news and rumors surrounding Assassin's Creed Infinity:<br/>
       We've yet to get a direct look at Assassin's Creed Infinity, but that hasn't stopped fans theorizing what it could bring. New Assassin's Creed game rumored to arrive before Infinity. 
       Bloomberg has reported that the next Assassin’s Creed game is a Valhalla spin-off, planned to arrive before Infinity. Allegedly codenamed "Rift", it's said to focus on Basim, who previously appeared in Valhalla. 
       Rift's reportedly a smaller game without the RPG-drive open-world gameplay, placing greater focus on stealth. Right now, Ubisoft hasn't officially commented on this report. Ubisoft formally confirmed Assassin's Creed Infinity back in July 2021. 
       Revealed in an official news post, Nathalie Bouchard, managing director at Ubisoft Quebec was joined by Christophe Derennes, managing director at Ubisoft Montreal. 
       While this confirmed very little about gameplay, Ubisoft announced Infinity's a joint effort between its two teams, focusing more on development details.
