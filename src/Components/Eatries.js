        Chicken is an all-time star and a versatile ingredient. The aromatic, though a little bland, white meat goes perfectly well with almost every recipe. 
        It is a flexible, nutritious, easy-to-use, and quick ingredient that regularly saves the day for a majority of chefs. 
        Using Chicken, you can make curries, rice dishes, stews, soups, and whatnot.
        However, perhaps, the highlight dish composed using this much-loved ingredient is the one and only, Chicken Sandwich. 
        It is a unique combination of soft bread, tender Chicken, sliced cucumber, tomatoes, mayonnaise, ketchup, and some spices.
        Right now, I have described you the classic version of a Chicken sandwich that you would have eaten a lot of times. 
        But, are you craving something different and a little spiced up?
        Well, then you need to try out these amazing and delicious Chicken sandwich variations.......
